Desmurget, Michel, Michael Jordan, Claude Prablanc, and Marc Jeannerod. Constrained and unconstrained movements involve different control strategies. J. Neurophysiol. 77: 1644–1650, 1997. This experiment was carried out to test whether or not the rules governing the execution of compliant and unconstrained movements are different (a compliant motion is defined as a motion constrained by external contact). To answer this question we examined the characteristics of visually directed movements performed with either the index fingertip (unconstrained) or a hand-held cursor (compliant). For each of these categories of movements, two experimental conditions were investigated: no instruction about hand path, and instruction to move the fingertip along a straight-line path. The results of the experiment were as follows. 1) The spatiotemporal characteristics of the compliant and unconstrained movements were fundamentally different when the subjects were not required to follow a specific hand path. 2) The instruction to perform straight movements modified the characteristics of the unconstrained movements, but not those of the compliant movements. 3) The target eccentricity influenced selectively the curvature of the “unconstrained–no path instruction” movements. Taken together, these results suggest that compliant and unconstrained movements involve different control strategies. Our data support the hypothesis that unconstrained motions are, unlike compliant motions, not programmed to follow a straight-line path in the task space. These observations provide a theoretical reference frame within which some apparently contradictory results reported in the movement generation literature may be explained.},

abstract = {This article presents a tentative theoretical framework for the study of asymmetry in the context of human bimanual action. It is emphasized that in humans most skilled manual activities involve two hands playing different roles, a fact that has been often overlooked in the experimental study of human manual lateralization. As an alternative to the current concepts of manual preference and manual superiority, whose relevance is limited to the particular case of unimanual actions, the more general concept of lateral preference is proposed, to denote preference for one of the two possible ways of assigning two roles to two hands. A simple model describing intermanual division of labor in the variety of human skilled manual activities is outlined. The two main assumptions of the model are the following. 1) The two hands represent two motors, that is, devices serving to create motion, whose internal (biomechanical and physiological) complexity is ignored in the suggested approach. 2) In humans, the two manual motors cooperate with one another as if they were assembled in series, thereby forming a kinematic chain: In right-handers allowed to follow their lateral preferences, motion produced by the right hand tends to articulate with motion produced by the left. It is suggested that the kinematic chain model may help in understanding the adaptive advantage of human manual specialization.}
